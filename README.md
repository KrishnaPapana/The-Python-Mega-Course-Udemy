[This](https://github.com/Shubh96/The-Python-Mega-Course-Udemy) repository  displays my progress in [The Python Mega Course from Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-python-mega-course/). This repository contains the code files which were a part of the course exercises, along with some PDFs for books on Python.
